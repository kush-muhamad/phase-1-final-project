**Phase 1 independent Final project**

This final project covers the contents covered in phase 1 with the focus mainly on the DOM , Events and CRUD 

My project is  a simple app that will help people adopt dogs i.e mans best frend

This project uses a mock database called  Postman which will handle the back end .

On This app , users are able to donate dogs  for donation using the POST request which update our database 

The app has two keys the dog breed name and the temperament
and image address

All this information will need to be filled  in the form and the donate button clicked which will display the dog breed on the web browser .

**Note** : the temperament is an array which we will be converted into one in the db.json file for it to render on the browser .
